    <small>A demo of a MVC login-system written in Java with a MySQL database connection.
    <br><br>
    MySQL:
    <br>
    primary key is an ID which is auto incremental. Each user in the database has the following:
    <ul>
      <li>ID</li>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Email</li>
      <li>Password</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Java:
    <br>
    For easier management, the classes are stored in packages/folders. In the folders, you'll find an interface, a controller and two repository classes (one class reads from an arraylist, the other from the database). The server port will be default (8080) â€“ but can be changed via the application.properties-file where you'll have to enter your password to your database in order to work properly.
